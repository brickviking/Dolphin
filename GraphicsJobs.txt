Dolphin does most of its graphics work by calling installed Windows library functions, including
the CRT from VC++2015..
 * Find out what windowing functions are called by the Dolphin image.
   Most of these are handled by the external libraries mentioned below.
 * Find suitable GTK replacements, or note the Windows functions that don't have an equivalent.
 * If GTK doesn't provide enough, perhaps look at Qt.
 * Install GTK for Windows, ditto for Qt.

External libraries that do graphics:
=====================
  ComDlgLibrary (%!)
  CommCtrlLibrary (%)
  ExternalResourceLibrary (%)
  GdiplusLibrary (%)
  ScintillaLibrary (%)
  ThemeLibrary (%)
  + MockThemeLibrary
  + VistaThemeLibrary
  PermanentLibrary:
  + GDILibrary (%)
  + UserLibrary (%)
  + VMLibrary (%)
=====================

How many of the other classes have some graphics context stuff in them?
