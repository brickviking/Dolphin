    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">It is quite likely that during debugging an out-of-process server started on-demand will fail to shut down. This could result from a problem in either server or client code that means that one or more server object does not get released. A Dolphin server will not shut down until all the COM objects it is serving have been released. This may not happen if there is a reference counting error, or perhaps a circular reference.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true"> If you have opened any browsers or other windows during the session, then these will prevent the server from shutting down, at least until the windows have all been closed. Leaving a browser open is a good way of ensuring that an image does not terminate in order to preserve any changes one has made in it.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">If necessary the errant server can be forcibly terminated using the Windows task manager. Be aware that forcibly terminating an out-of-process COM server on Windows 9x may cause system instability, though this is perfectly safe on Windows NT/2000/2003/XP.</text></para>
