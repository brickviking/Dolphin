    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">For the first time since Dolphin 2.1 we are re-introducing a completely free version back into our product range. We originally withdrew the 2.1 edition because its user interface had fallen behind the commercial versions and, overall, we felt that it was a poor advertisement for the product.

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">The Community Edition has the cool new look of X6 and features an expanded class library compared with the previous free editions.
