This is very often the case with Smalltalk code and you should find that, as a matter of good style, you&apos;ll end up writing a lot of rather short methods rather than a few long ones. This makes it very easy for the reader to assimilate how a method works. Also, by breaking down a program into many small chunks, it becomes more flexible. A method is more likely to be re-usable in future situations if it does not try to do too much at once. By re-using pre-written methods your programs will be smaller and easier to maintain.</text></para>
